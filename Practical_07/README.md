The script polynomial when runned computes polynomials and the value for e, the memory.c script allocates memory, fills array with ones and then frees the memory. Both scripts can be run using the following two commands, gcc polynomial.c -o polynomial -lm, then run ./polynomial .The second script can be ran using, gcc memory.c -o memory -lm, then run ./memory .
